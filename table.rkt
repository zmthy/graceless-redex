;; This file contains tests demonstrating the behaviours of the
;; different models with respect to the columns of Table 1 in the
;; paper.
;;
;; Each test case defines an expression in Graceless, and then for
;; each model evaluates the expression and verifies that a
;; particular result is obtained. The possible results used in
;; these tests are:
;; - stuck, indicating that the evaluation could not proceed.
;; - [method names here], indicating that the resulting object
;;   has exactly the methods listed.
;; Different behaviours for a property are detected by returning
;; objects with different method sets for each case.
;;
;; Comments with each defined term, and next to each test call,
;; describe the expected behaviour in each condition. Models with
;; different behaviours are given different expected return values.
;;
;; We do not test for the -first column, as all our models are
;; objects-first, for Overload, as it is by construction, or for
;; Stable, because it is determined by the other columns.
;;
;; The models are represented by two- or three-character codes
;; in the names of the "test-->>xxx" functions:
;;    GF   Forwarding
;;    GD   Delegation
;;    GC   Concatenation
;;    GO   All of the above
;;
;;    GM   Merged identity
;;    GU   Uniform identity
;;    GI   Both of the above
;;
;;    GMU  Multiple uniform
;;    GTU  Method transformation (multiple)
;;    GPU  Positional inheritance (multiple)
;;
;;    GMF  Multiple forwarding
;;    GMD  Multiple delegation
;;    GMC  Multiple concatenation
;;    GMO  All three of the above
;;
;;    GTF  Method transformation with forwarding
;;    GTD  Method transformation with delegation
;;    GTC  Method transformation with concatenation
;;    GTO  All three of the above
;;
;;    GPF  Positional forwarding
;;    GPD  Positional delegation
;;    GPC  Positional concatenation
;;    GPO  All three of the above
;;
;; The G[MTP][FDCO] models exactly match the behaviours of the
;; corresponding base model, with the addition of multiple
;; inheritance of some kind. The tests below repeat the
;; conditions for each model to demonstrate this.
